## Description
The login button does not display any loading indicator during the 
authentication process with the `performance_glitch_user`. The user 
receives no feedback that the system is processing their request.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to https://www.saucedemo.com
2. Enter username: `performance_glitch_user`
3. Enter password: `secret_sauce`
4. Click the "Login" button
5. Observe the button behavior during the wait

## Expected Result
The button should display a loading state (spinner, "Loading..." text, 
or become disabled) while the system processes the authentication.

## Actual Result
The button remains visually unchanged for approximately 3-5 seconds 
with no state change, creating uncertainty about whether the system 
is responding.

## Impact
The user may click multiple times believing the first click was not 
registered, potentially generating duplicate requests.
