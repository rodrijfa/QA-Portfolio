## Description
With error_user, the system allows checkout to proceed with the Last Name 
field empty, without displaying any error message, despite this field 
being required for other users.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Log in with error_user / secret_sauce
2. Add any product to the cart
3. Go to cart and click "Checkout"
4. Fill in First Name and Postal Code
5. Leave Last Name empty (or attempt to type and verify it remains empty)
6. Click "Continue"

## Expected Result
The system should display an error: "Last Name is required" 
and prevent advancing until the field is completed.

## Actual Result
The system advances to the next checkout step without displaying 
any validation error.

## Impact
Orders with incomplete data could be processed in the system, 
generating operational and shipping issues.
