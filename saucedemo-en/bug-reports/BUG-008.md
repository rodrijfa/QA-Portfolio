from being completed.

3. Go to cart and click "Checkout"
4. Fill in First Name and Postal Code (Last Name does not accept input)

6. Review the summary and click "Finish"

## Expected Result
The purchase should be completed and display the confirmation screen 
with the message "Thank you for your order".
